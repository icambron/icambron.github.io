Then I was one of the first hires at Contact Networks, where I built a large part of the product and helped grow the team and business. Thomson Reuters acquired the company in 2007. I cofounded an AI startup called Zensight that helped sales reps customize their messaging to enhance sales. In December 2017, we sold the company to Seismic, where I work now. Between all those, I&#39;ve done a lot of consulting.</p>

<p><strong>Position</strong>: I&#39;ve been the only coder on a project, working late into the night fueled by caffeine, and I&#39;ve been the architect for a team, orchestrating development cycles and drawing pretty system design box diagrams. And a few things in between.</p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong>: I work on everything from database schemas, to application middleware, to business logic, to user experience, to UI implementation, to product planning. Though as you can see from this page, I&#39;m not the world&#39;s best graphic designer.</p>

<p><strong>Specialties</strong>: A long list of programming languages, platforms, tools, and patterns goes here. I know enough of them to know I can learn the ones I don&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>OSS</strong>: I&#39;m the author of the popular JS date/time library <a href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/">Luxon</a> and a member of its parent project, <a href="http://momentjs.com">Moment.js</a>. I also maintain several other OSS libraries (see the <a href="/projects.html">OSS Projects</a> page), and have made contributions to a slew of other projects. You can see it all <a href="http://github.com/icambron">at Github</a>.</p>

The product uses a combination of machine learning techniques, near-realtime data processing, and a simple, slick UI. It&#39;s built with Clojure, ClojureScript, AWS, React, and elbow grease.</p>

<p>Zensight was acquired by Seismic in December 2017.</p>

The product allowed you to subscribe to various calendars (like bands, bars, Meetups, etc) and see them in a Twitter-style feed. Users could then add them to their calendars with one click, or republish them to their followers. The product worked really well, but we were never able to get the business model sorted out, and eventually we were forced to set it aside.</p>

<p>I did all the architecture and coding as well as a good portion of the product design. The technology stack was Rails, Faye, MongoDB, and Knockout.js.</p>

<p>Our startup was acquired by Thomson Reuters in 2007, and I continued my role as architect while we grew our team and product.</p>
